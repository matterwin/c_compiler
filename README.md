# Overview

Certainly, simplifying the scope of the C++ language subset you want to support can make the task of building a C++ compiler more manageable. By focusing on a subset of the language, you can reduce complexity and make the implementation process more straightforward.

Here are some aspects you might consider when defining a simplified subset of C++:

Basic Language Features: Focus on supporting fundamental language features such as variables, control structures (if, else, while, for), functions, and basic data types (int, double, char).

Classes and Objects: Include support for defining and using classes and objects. This is a fundamental aspect of C++ programming and allows for object-oriented programming (OOP).

Pointers: Include support for pointers, which are central to many C++ programming techniques. However, you might choose to limit or exclude more advanced pointer features like pointer arithmetic.

Functions: Support for defining and calling functions, including function overloading.

Standard Library: Decide whether to include any parts of the C++ standard library. For a minimal compiler, you might choose to omit standard library support entirely or include only a subset of essential functions.

Templates and Advanced Features: As you mentioned, you can choose to exclude advanced features like templates, multiple inheritance, exceptions, and other language features that add complexity to the compiler implementation.

By defining a simplified subset of the language, you can focus on implementing a functional compiler that targets this subset while excluding more advanced and complex language features. This approach can make the project more manageable, especially if you're new to compiler development or want to build a minimal compiler as a learning exercise. As you gain experience and confidence, you can always expand the scope of your compiler to support more language features.


# Steps

Lexical Analysis (Tokenization): In this stage, the compiler breaks down the input source code into tokens. Tokens are the smallest units of the code, such as keywords, identifiers, literals, and operators. The lexical analyzer reads characters from the source code and groups them into tokens according to predefined rules.

Syntax Analysis (Parsing): The parser analyzes the structure of the source code based on the grammar rules of the programming language. It checks whether the tokens generated by the lexical analyzer follow the syntax rules specified by the language grammar. If the code is syntactically correct, the parser constructs a parse tree or an abstract syntax tree (AST) representing the structure of the code.

Semantic Analysis: This stage checks the meaning of the code beyond just its structure. It involves type checking, scope resolution, and other checks to ensure that the code adheres to the semantic rules of the programming language. For example, it verifies that variables are declared before use, function calls match the declared prototypes, and types are used appropriately.

Intermediate Code Generation: At this stage, the compiler translates the source code into an intermediate representation that is easier to work with than the original source code but is still platform-independent. This intermediate code may be in the form of an abstract syntax tree, three-address code, or another intermediate representation suitable for further optimization and code generation.

Optimization: In this optional stage, the compiler applies various optimizations to improve the efficiency of the generated code. Optimization techniques may include constant folding, loop optimization, dead code elimination, and many others. The goal is to produce code that runs faster and uses fewer resources without changing its behavior.

Code Generation: Finally, the compiler translates the optimized intermediate code into machine code or another target language suitable for execution on a specific hardware platform. This stage involves generating assembly code or directly emitting machine code instructions that correspond to the operations specified in the intermediate representation.

Linking (for multi-file programs): If the program consists of multiple source files or external libraries, the linker combines the generated object code into a single executable file. It resolves references to external symbols and addresses any dependencies between different parts of the program.
